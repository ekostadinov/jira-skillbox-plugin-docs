## What Is JIRA Testing Skillbox plugin?
To support and enhance your QA testing, we enhanced the process of test design, execution and reporting. You, as a tester, don’t have to change windows, stack pop-ups or go to another tool in order to document and support your activities. Everything you need to do is context-based, and available to you on one main
screen. There are some cool features of industry curated catalogue and a smart built-in search for better utilization of
the software testing syllabus.

## What Is It For?
The plugin is designed to do the following:
• Maximize your QA testing
• Empower Effortless lean documentation
• Support Context and Data-driven test case design

## How To Use?
Use this all-in-one toolbox when you want to further improve and extend your test ideas via our search. You can start
by adding one of the many templates, with ready to use content and easy flows of assessment, planning and reporting.
Once your testing documentation and artifacts are structured, use the curated catalogue of heuristics, checklists and mnemonics
to support your testing.
